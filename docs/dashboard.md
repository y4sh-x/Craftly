# The dashboard

[← Back to docs index](README.md)

The dashboard is your home base: every server, its live status, and a running feed of what's been happening.

## The summary tiles

Across the top:

- **Servers online** - how many of your servers are currently running.
- **Players connected** - the total player count across all running servers.
- **Updates available** - how many servers, packs, or mods have a newer version ([see Updates](updates.md)).
- **Docker** - whether the panel can reach the Docker daemon, and its version.

## Server cards

Each server shows as a card with its status (Running, Starting, Stopped, Crashed), the type and Minecraft version, and its game port. For running servers you also get live **players**, **CPU**, **memory**, and **disk** usage, updated continuously.

Click a card to open that server. The empty **Create a server** card and the top-bar **Create a Server** button both start the [creation wizard](servers.md).

You can search and sort your servers, and switch between grid and list layouts with the toggle on the right.

## Recent activity

The feed at the bottom is a live, human-readable audit trail: logins, backups, blueprint exports, update checks, chat-command changes, server starts and stops, and more. Every entry is tagged with the server it belongs to (or the panel itself) and how long ago it happened. The full history lives on the [Activity](activity.md) page.
