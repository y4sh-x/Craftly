# Shrinking a world

[← Back to docs index](README.md)

Over time a world spreads out: every place a player has ever walked, flown, or
been carried by an Ender pearl leaves generated chunks on disk, even if nobody
ever went back. **Shrink world** removes the chunks that almost nobody has spent
time in, so the world takes less space. Minecraft rebuilds a removed area from
the world seed the moment someone travels there again, so this is safe for
land nobody is using, but anything a player _built_ in a spot they barely stood
in would go too, which is why you should take a backup first (the backup is the
undo).

## What counts as "rarely visited"

Every chunk records how long players have spent standing in it (Minecraft calls
this `InhabitedTime`). Shrink world removes any chunk under **30 seconds** of
total player time by default; the shrink dialog lets you change that threshold
(1 second to 1 hour) and how many chunks around the spawn to keep (default 8,
`0` turns spawn protection off).

What is kept, always:

- The area around the world's **spawn point** (read from `level.dat`) in the
  overworld. The Nether, the End, and custom dimensions have no spawn area.
- Any chunk whose visit time could not be read, for example a world saved with
  a compression format the panel does not decode (LZ4). The preview and the
  result tell you how many such chunks were skipped.

Every dimension of the world is covered: Bukkit-style sibling folders
(`world_nether`, `world_the_end`) as well as the vanilla and Forge/Fabric
layout (`world/DIM-1`, `world/DIM1`, `world/dimensions/<namespace>/<name>`).
When a chunk is removed, its entities and villager points of interest go with
it, so a regenerated chunk does not inherit stale mobs, minecarts, or job sites.

## Doing it from the Worlds tab

1. Take a backup from the **Backups** tab. Shrinking from the Worlds tab does
   not take one for you.
2. Open **World → Worlds**, find the world, and click the shrink icon.
3. Click **Preview** to see roughly how many chunks (and how many megabytes)
   would be removed. Nothing is changed yet; a preview works while the server
   is running.
4. Click **Shrink World**. Shrinking edits the world files directly, so the
   server must be stopped: either stop it first, or tick the option to stop it,
   shrink, and start it again in one go (the server is started again even if
   the shrink fails). Progress shows in the task tray.

## Doing it as part of a backup

On the **Backups** tab, tick **"Also shrink the world afterwards"** before
**Back Up Now**. The backup archive is written first (that archive is your
undo), then the world is shrunk, but only if the server is stopped. If the
server is running, the backup still runs and the shrink is skipped with a note.

Scheduled backups have the same option: in the schedule editor, choose the
**Backup** task and tick **"Shrink the world after each backup"**. Pair it with
a **Stop server** schedule a few minutes earlier if you want it to run
unattended.
