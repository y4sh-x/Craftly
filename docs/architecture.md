# Architecture

[← Back to docs index](README.md)

Craftly is a single-process, server-rendered Node.js application. It manages
Minecraft servers that run as Docker containers using the
[itzg/docker-minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) image, talking to the
Docker daemon over its API (never by shelling out to the `docker` CLI).

## Runtime shape

- **Express + Handlebars** render pages server-side. There is no SPA; the browser JS in `public/js/`
  is hand-written progressive enhancement. An esbuild step (`pnpm run build:js`) bundles and
  minifies it into `public/dist/js/`; the app serves that bundle when it's present and the raw
  source otherwise, so a dev run without a build still works.
- **`node:sqlite`** (built into Node; the panel requires Node ≥ 24) is the database - synchronous,
  zero native modules, WAL mode. A small versioned-migration runner applies `src/db/migrations/*` on
  boot. Prepared statements are cached in `src/db/index.js` keyed on the SQL text.
- **`ws`** carries the live console and stats streams. Both are **brokered**: one upstream
  `docker logs --follow` (or `docker stats`) per server, demuxed once and fanned out to every
  connected tab, rather than one upstream per viewer. The console broker keeps a small replay
  buffer for late-joining tabs and drops a subscriber whose socket falls too far behind rather than
  stalling the shared stream.
- **dockerode** is the only way the app talks to Docker. The endpoint is auto-detected per platform
  (Windows named pipe vs. unix socket).
- **All persistent state lives under one directory** (`$DATA_DIR`, default `./data`). Copying that
  directory migrates the entire panel.

## Layering

Dependencies flow in one direction:

```
                 ┌─────────────────────────────┐
   HTTP  ───────▶│  web/routes/*  (+ middleware)│   parse & validate input, shape responses
                 └──────────────┬──────────────┘
                                │
                 ┌──────────────▼──────────────┐
                 │         services/*          │   domain logic (the actual features)
                 └───┬─────────┬─────────┬─────┘
                     │         │         │
        ┌────────────▼──┐ ┌────▼────┐ ┌──▼──────────┐
        │   docker/*    │ │  db/*   │ │  storage/*  │   infrastructure
        └───────────────┘ └─────────┘ └─────────────┘
```

- **`web/routes/`** - one router per domain (`servers`, `players`, `worlds`, `crashes`, `blueprints`,
  `files`, …), mounted in `web/app.js`. Routers validate with zod, call a service, and return JSON
  or render a view. Business logic does not belong here. Two routers are mounted in the **public
  zone**, before `requireAuth`: `routes/status.js` (opt-in per-server HTML status pages) and
  `routes/apiV1.js` (`/api/v1`, a read-only JSON API authenticated by an admin-minted Bearer token
  from `services/apiTokens.js`, off unless enabled in Settings; see `docs/public-api.md`).
- **`services/`** - the heart of the app. Each service owns one domain and may depend on
  infrastructure and on other services.
- **`docker/`** - dockerode wrappers: `connect` (endpoint detection + daemon health), `containers`
  (create/start/stop/recreate with bind mounts, memory/CPU limits, and labels), `logs`, `stats`,
  `images`, and a `watcher` that turns Docker events into history + crash detection.
- **`db/`** - the SQLite wrapper and migration runner.
- **`storage/`** - the `./data` bootstrap, the **path guard** (`safeJoin`, the file-safety
  backbone), and the background size-indexer + quota enforcement.

Cross-cutting:

- **`config/`** - environment config plus the **field catalog**: the single source of truth for
  server settings. Every itzg environment variable is catalogued (label, help, type, unit, default,
  validation, section, danger flags). The wizard, settings forms, and zod validation are all derived
  from it, so exposing a new setting is a data change, not new UI plumbing.
- **`events/`** - `recordEvent()` is the one entry point for the history log; lifecycle events also
  capture container-log excerpts to `data/logs/<id>/events/`.
- **`ws/`** - authenticated console + stats WebSockets (session cookie verified on upgrade, `Origin`
  checked to block cross-site hijacking), brokered per server (see "Runtime shape").
- **`logger.js` + `instrument.js`** - `require('./logger')(label)` returns a per-module
  [Pino](https://getpino.io) logger; level from `LOG_LEVEL`, `makeFailureThrottle()` keeps a
  persistently-failing background loop to one log line plus a "recovered" line.
  `src/utils/logSanitize.js` redacts credential-shaped keys and webhook tokens from the structured
  metadata; `src/config/logLevel.js` is the shared level allowlist (kept separate to avoid a
  require cycle with `config`). `src/instrument.js` is a dormant Sentry seam, loaded first in
  `src/server.js`. `src/web/middleware/requestLog.js` writes one access-log line per request
  (skipping `/healthz` and static assets). ESLint enforces `no-console` under `src/**`, with
  `preflight.js`, `instrument.js`, and `config/index.js` exempt (they run before the logger exists).
- **Rate limiting** - `src/web/middleware/rateLimit.js` puts `express-rate-limit` in front of `/api`
  (`RATE_LIMIT_API_PER_MIN`, default 1200) and the login / 2FA / setup POSTs
  (`RATE_LIMIT_AUTH_PER_15MIN`, default 100); `0` disables a limiter. It keys on `req.ip`, so
  `TRUST_PROXY` matters behind a proxy. `/api/v1` has its own per-token limiter
  (`RATE_LIMIT_PUBLIC_API_PER_MIN`, default 120), keyed on a hash of the Bearer token with an IP
  fallback. A separate per-account soft counter in
  `src/web/middleware/auth.js` handles the login lockout (per-IP and account-global, decaying).
- **Authorization**: two layers. The global role (`requireAuth` → `requireRole` / `requireWrite` in
  `src/web/middleware/auth.js`) gates panel-wide actions and is the default on every server. Per-server
  permissions (`src/services/permissions.js`, nine capabilities stored as a JSON list per
  `(user, server)` in `user_server_permissions`) refine that default for one server; every
  `/api/servers/:id` route, sub-router mount, page, WebSocket, and fleet-wide listing goes through
  `src/web/middleware/serverAccess.js` (`serverScope`, mounted on the `/servers/:id` prefix of both
  the API and the page router, hides a server without `view` as a 404; `requireCap(cap)` names the
  capability a route needs). Writes that name their server in the body (schedules, world extract and
  install, blueprint export) are opened for viewers by `requireWrite` only for that server, and each
  such route checks the capability itself. `test/permissions-routes.test.js` walks the live router
  stacks and fails if a server-scoped write route, mount, or page has no gate.

## Key domain behaviors

- **Modpacks are always pinned.** The image auto-upgrades unpinned packs on every restart, so the
  panel resolves "latest" to a concrete version id at install time and pins it. Upgrades are an
  explicit orchestrated flow (`updates/`): preview → pre-update backup → graceful stop → re-pin →
  recreate → health-monitor → one-click rollback.
- **The custom-mod overlay** is panel-managed: user-added mods land in the deduplicated library and
  are hard-linked into the server so they survive pack updates. Disabling is class-aware. Because
  the library keeps every build it has downloaded, an update records the build it replaced
  (`server_content.previous_*`) and can be reverted from local files alone.
- **A Minecraft version upgrade has to be earned.** `services/compat.js` scans a server's mods -
  resolved from panel-installed rows, then the CurseForge pack manifest, then by content hash
  against Modrinth/CurseForge - and builds a (loader, Minecraft version) support matrix per project
  out of CurseForge's `latestFilesIndexes` (200 projects per request) and Modrinth's per-project
  version list (one request per project, which is what keeps loader and version paired). The update
  checker offers only the newest version EVERY mod supports, and offers nothing at all when the
  answer cannot be established: no scan, a scan for a different version or loader, one that never
  finished, or a jar neither registry recognises. Scans are manual only, and their progress and
  partial results live in `version_compat` (not in the in-memory `services/tasks.js`), so a refresh
  or a panel restart resumes instead of hanging on a spinner; `reconcileScans()` marks scans
  orphaned by a shutdown on the next boot.
- **Ports** are allocated from a base scheme (game from `PORT_GAME_START` upward, RCON = game +
  `PORT_RCON_OFFSET`, Bedrock from `PORT_BEDROCK_START`), probed for availability, and reserved in
  the DB.
- **Disk quotas** are enforced by the panel because Docker can't cap bind-mount usage: the indexer
  caches per-directory sizes and disk-growing operations are gated on them.
- **Secrets** (RCON passwords, API keys, TOTP secrets, the Discord webhook URL) are encrypted at
  rest with AES-256-GCM using a dedicated random key at `$DATA_DIR/.secret-key` (mode `0600`,
  auto-generated). It's independent of `SESSION_SECRET`; a `SESSION_SECRET`-derived key is kept as a
  decrypt-only fallback for values written before the dedicated key existed, and
  `src/services/secretsMigration.js` re-encrypts those under the dedicated key once on boot.
  A `.secret-key` that exists but doesn't parse is a hard boot error (it is never silently
  regenerated over the top). Blueprints strip all secrets on export.
- **`server.properties` is panel-owned but env-shadowed.** The itzg image re-asserts every
  env-backed property on each start (`OVERRIDE_SERVER_PROPERTIES` defaults true), so a value the
  panel edits directly - World Controls PvP/difficulty, the whitelist toggle, the Files editor -
  would be silently reverted on the next start unless the matching env var is removed and the
  container recreated. Every direct property write goes through `writeServerProperties()` (whole
  file) or `setServerProperty()` (one key) in `src/services/servers.js`, which atomically rewrite
  the file, un-set the env var behind each changed key (via the `prop:` attribute on catalog
  fields, checked in tests against the image's own property definitions), and flag
  `pending_recreate`. Difficulty is written to the file as well as sent over RCON, because a
  dedicated server re-applies the `difficulty` property on every boot. Minecraft itself re-saves
  server.properties from its boot-time values on `whitelist on/off`, which would undo edits made
  while the server runs, so the running whitelist toggle snapshots the file first and writes it back
  with only `white-list` changed. The env
  vars stay fully configurable at creation (the wizard renders them and they apply once); they only
  un-pin the first time the panel edits the underlying property. MOTD is the same contract: a direct
  `motd` file edit un-sets it, so the last write wins.

## Data & wire formats

- **`data/panel.db`** - the SQLite database. Snapshotted daily via `VACUUM INTO` to
  `data/backups/_panel/` (newest 14 kept); `PRAGMA integrity_check` runs on boot.
- **`data/.session-secret`** - the auto-generated cookie-signing secret, created on first run if
  `SESSION_SECRET` is unset. Deleting it rotates the secret (which invalidates sessions).
- **`data/.secret-key`** - the dedicated 32-byte at-rest encryption key (mode `0600`), auto-created
  on first run. Independent of `SESSION_SECRET`; deleting it makes every stored credential
  undecryptable, so it belongs with your backups.
- **Blueprints (`.mcserver.zip`)** - a zip with a `manifest.json` describing config, resources, the
  pinned pack reference, the overlay manifest (source URLs + sha256), chosen config files, and
  optionally a world. Import re-downloads and hash-verifies each mod and assigns fresh ports.
- **Docker containers** created by the panel are named and labelled so the watcher can find them;
  the panel owns their full lifecycle.

## Boot sequence

1. `require('./instrument')` (the Sentry seam) before anything else, then `require('./preflight')`
   to fail clearly on an unsupported Node version.
2. Load config; ensure/generate `.session-secret` **and** `.secret-key`.
3. `ensureDataRoot()` - create the `./data` layout, wipe `tmp/`.
4. Run DB migrations, then `PRAGMA integrity_check` (logs loudly, points at `data/backups/_panel`
   on failure).
5. Re-encrypt any legacy `SESSION_SECRET`-keyed secrets under `.secret-key` (`secretsMigration`).
6. Mark version compatibility scans left running by a previous process as interrupted
   (`compat.reconcileScans()`), then seed starter blueprints (guarded).
7. Start the HTTP + WS server. On an exposed bind, print the first-run `/setup` PIN.
8. Install the post-boot runtime guard (catches uncaught faults; `CRAFTLY_EXIT_ON_FATAL=1` makes it
   hard-exit for supervised deployments).
9. Start background services: WS broker, storage indexer, crash + inventory watchers, scheduler,
   Discord event bridge, and the **daily maintenance timer** (prune old analytics rows + snapshot
   `panel.db`).
10. Initialize Docker **in the background**. The UI is fully usable while the daemon is down;
    Docker features light up when it becomes reachable. Once connected, `refreshStatuses({ boot })`
    reconciles cached statuses, emits a one-time `offline-after-restart` event for a server that was
    up before the panel restarted and won't be brought back, and the boot loop starts
    `auto_start` servers plus recovers `auto_restart` servers found crashed during the outage
    (respecting crash-loop backoff).

> The instrument-before-preflight order is a deliberate trade-off: it lets a future Sentry wiring
> patch the runtime first, at the cost of a slightly less friendly message on a truly ancient Node.

## Build pipeline

`pnpm run build` = `build:css` (Tailwind → `public/css/app.css`) + `build:js` (esbuild →
`public/dist/js/`, ESM with code-splitting). `postinstall` runs **CSS only**. `public/css/app.css`
and `public/dist/` are gitignored build artifacts; the Dockerfile build stage runs the full
`pnpm run build` and copies `public/` into the runtime image. Static assets are served
`immutable`/long-cache for fingerprinted files, short-cache for CSS/JS, and `no-cache` for HTML and
`/api`.
