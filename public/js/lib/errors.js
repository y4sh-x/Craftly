// One friendly fallback for failed API calls. Call sites still prefer a
// server-supplied `data.error` message; this fills in when there isn't one, so
// a user never sees a bare status code or a raw exception string.
//
// Usage:
//   toast(data.error || friendlyError(res, { action: 'save your settings' }));
//   throw new Error(data.error || friendlyError(res, { action: 'load the list' }));
//   } catch (err) { toast(friendlyError(err, { action: 'save your settings' })); }
